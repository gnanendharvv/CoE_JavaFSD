            <img src="images/india-aus.jpg" alt="India vs Australia" />
                <p>India secured a last-ball victory against Australia in a high-pressure T20 match at the Wankhede Stadium. Virat Kohli's 85* led the team to victory.</p>
                <p>By the end of the Australian innings that saw the hosts set a 187-run target in the third T20I in Sydney, Shardul Thakur‚Äôs figures read 43/1 in four overs ‚Äì the most expensive among the five Indian bowlers. The seamer can argue the numbers only revealed half the story.

                    Twice Thakur was denied Glenn Maxwell‚Äôs wicket due to sloppy catching. Deepak Chahar dropped him on 38 and Yuzvendra Chahal gave him a second life on 53, both easy chances. The let-offs were among India‚Äôs many poor efforts on the field, and combined with Matthew Wade‚Äôs career-best 80 off 53 balls, they helped Australia post a 185-plus total for the second game in a row.</p>

            <img src="images/lebron.jpg" alt="LeBron James in action" />
            <p>LeBron James dropped 40 points as the LA Lakers defeated the Golden State Warriors in a thrilling Game 5 of the NBA playoffs.</p>
            <p>After being forced to miss two games with the Los Angeles Lakers in an eight-day span, the NBA forward re-emerged Dec. 15 to help his team score a 116-110 win against the Memphis Grizzlies ‚Äî though he was reluctant to step away to treat a foot injury.

                ‚ÄúIf it was up to just me, I probably would've played,‚Äù James told reporters of his brief hiatus following the Lakers‚Äô victory, per ESPN. ‚ÄúIt would've been hard to keep me away from it. I have a team and I got to listen to them as well. They look out for my best interest.‚Äù
                
                The time away seemed to pay off, as he contributed 18 points to the team‚Äôs final total against the Grizzlies.
                
                ‚ÄúI had an opportunity to take more days and get my mind, body and everything where I wanted it to be for tonight,‚Äù James continued. ‚ÄúAnd it worked out.‚Äù </p>
